This project enables embedding and extracting messages within PNG images by manipulating the least significant bits of pixel data. It handles the PNG filtering methods used during compression { None, Sub, Up, Average, and Paeth filters } by implementing their corresponding unfiltering algorithms to accurately reconstruct raw pixel data.
